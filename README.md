# Known Issues/Errors

There are a few known issues. The create profile button does not work when deployed on heroku. The links in the side bar should only display login or create profile for someone who is new, and when they create a profile it should show the rest of the links.

The cart page can be dialed in and fine tuned and the 21 plus year old pop up should not blink everytime a page is loaded.

There are many more errors that we may have missed. Feel free to pull repository, push, and pull request any fixes!
